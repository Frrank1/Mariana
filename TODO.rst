TODOS:
======

* Make concatenation the default behaviour, and replace Composite layer by an Additive layer.
* Finish new training paradygm (it is way cooler than the actual one)
* Make just-in-time generated Theano functions. Theano function should be created/compiled just if needed, and the model should be able to derive custom functions from pre-existing ones.
* Allow parameters in abstractions (it is cleaner than to have to modify layer attributes)
* Merge GradientDescent and MomentumGradientDescent in a single scenario. Add in gradiant ascent as well.
